Intelligent Video Automation System
This project is a multi-faceted Python application that processes a YouTube video, extracts and analyzes speech commands, performs object detection, and executes system commands based on the analysis. It serves as a proof-of-concept for creating an intelligent agent that can understand and interact with video content.

Key Features
Video Downloading: Automatically downloads the audio from a specified YouTube video URL.

Speech-to-Text: Converts the extracted audio into a text-based command using the Google Web Speech API.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Analyzes the transcribed text to understand the user's intent.

Computer Vision: (Conceptual) Uses OpenCV and a YOLO model to detect objects within the video frames.

System Automation: Executes predefined actions (e.g., opening a website, running a script) based on the analyzed command.

Skills Used
Python Programming

Video Downloading (yt-dlp library)

Audio Extraction (os module for running ffmpeg)

Speech-to-Text (speech_recognition library)

Computer Vision (cv2 library for object detection)

Deep Learning (Conceptual understanding of YOLO for object detection)

Natural Language Processing (transformers library for text classification)

System Command Execution (os module)

Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following dependencies installed on your system.

Python Libraries
You can install all the required Python packages using pip:

pip install yt-dlp speechrecognition transformers opencv-python ffmpeg-python

External Tools
FFmpeg: This project relies on ffmpeg for audio extraction and conversion. Ensure that ffmpeg is installed and added to your system's PATH. You can download it from the official FFmpeg website.

YOLO Model Files: The object detection feature requires the YOLO model's weight and configuration files (yolov3.weights and yolov3.cfg). These files are not included in the repository due to their size. You will need to download them and place them in the same directory as your script. You can find them with a quick search online.

Installation and Usage
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
# Alternatively, use the command from the Prerequisites section

Download YOLO Files:
Place yolov3.weights and yolov3.cfg in the project directory.

Run the Script:
Modify the youtube_url variable in the if __name__ == "__main__": block to the video you want to process.

# In your main script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    youtube_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnyNMbx4TEE"
    process_youtube_video(youtube_url)

Then, execute the script from your terminal:

python your_script_name.py

The program will then sequentially download the video, process the audio, analyze the content, and execute the final command.

How it Works
The script operates in a pipeline:

download_youtube_video: Fetches the best quality audio stream from a given YouTube URL and saves it as an MP4 file.

speech_to_text: Converts the MP4 audio into a WAV format using ffmpeg and then uses the speech_recognition library to transcribe the speech into a text string.

detect_objects: (Currently conceptual) This function is set up to load a YOLO model and process video frames to identify objects. The current implementation only prints a message but can be expanded to draw bounding boxes or log detected objects.

analyze_command: Uses the transformers library to run a text classification pipeline on the transcribed text, providing an analysis of the command.

execute_action: Contains a simple if-elif-else block to perform system actions based on keywords found in the command text.

This modular design allows for easy expansion and integration of more sophisticated models and functionalities.
